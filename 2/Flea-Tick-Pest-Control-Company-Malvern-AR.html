<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as damaging to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the experts.</p>

<p>More details is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of removing detrimental impacts of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Do not base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests assault plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae damage berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>
<p>The global price quotes vary in magnitude, but it is believed around 25% of crops are lost to pests and diseases, such as insects, fungis and other plant pathogens (FAO Crop Potential Customers and Food Scenario 2009).
