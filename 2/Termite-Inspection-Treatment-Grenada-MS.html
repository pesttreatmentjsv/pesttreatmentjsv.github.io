<p>It is an environment approach to crop production and defense that integrates various management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and reduce the use of pesticides.

Don't base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin leaves and berries coming from the ground, and birds consume fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also consisted of to divert insect attack far from the crop. Managing pests can be performed in numerous ways but an efficient method is to clean out the bugs routinely.
