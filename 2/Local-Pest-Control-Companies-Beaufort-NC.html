IPM coordinates making use of pest biology, ecological details, and offered innovation to avoid inappropriate levels of pest damage by the most economical methods, while lessening threat to individuals, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later expanded to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance. </p>
