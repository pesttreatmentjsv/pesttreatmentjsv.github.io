<p>Very impressed with the expert technique of Sunlight Pest Control group, my house was terribly damaged by termite but they have done excellent task and they were very courteous. Illness, weeds, and insects can trigger irreparable and expensive damage to animals and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic manufacturers, formulators, service, suppliers, and suppliers.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a reliable and environmentally delicate  method to pest management that counts on a mix of sensible practices.

<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low ecological effect.

<p>Kaolin particle movies used in organic farming may control some pests, however can negatively affect natural enemies and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural opponent populations, however a higher number of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
