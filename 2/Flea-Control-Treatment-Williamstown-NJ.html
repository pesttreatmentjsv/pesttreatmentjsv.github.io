<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a environmentally sensitive and effective method to pest management that depends on a mix of common-sense practices. IPM is an approach to ensure financial practicality at both customer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to earn a profit), environmental safety through a balanced usage of all available pest control choices, and social reputation considering that IPM-based food is safe and budget friendly.</p>
<p>The numerous factors involved in the value chain of the insect pest control market include raw material providers, R&D institutes, insect pest control options making companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and federal government bodies & regulative associations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).</p>
