<p>Select the least toxic (or lowest schedule) home pesticide readily available. The majority of people usually think of pest control throughout the warmer months, when swarms of insects attempt to invade their houses and lawns, however, pests understand no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides originated from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring materials.</p>

Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if readily available; keep in mind, do not kill the helpful insects.

IPM worries making use of non-chemical control methods, such as exclusion or trapping, before chemical alternatives.</p>
