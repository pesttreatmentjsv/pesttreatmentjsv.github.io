The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the central theme of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<h3>Control Pest Humboldt Tennessee</h2>
<p>The term "integrated" was therefore associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>When you find the very first pests in your trap, you understand it's time to introduce your control strategies, such as putting your row covers in position and using Bacillus thuringiensis.
