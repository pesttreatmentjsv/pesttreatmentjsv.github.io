<p>A personalized post-construction and pre-construction service to control or avoid the attack from termites. The historical and more widespread use of this term is limited to use of natural opponents to manage populations of pest organisms.

Young scientists are working on 'population genomics' of three types of natural opponents, on genome-based selection of natural enemies, and on predatory mites that are also reliable in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>The decision of the proper cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect types or life stages. </p>
