We just utilize government-approved and environmentally-friendly pesticides and products for our treatments that are safe for children and pets too.

<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Deal with a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, tackle termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with an expert bait gun, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of an entire location.
