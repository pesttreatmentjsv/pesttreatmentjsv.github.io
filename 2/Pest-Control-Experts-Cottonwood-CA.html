<p>New generation of GPS, sensors-fitted farm equipment, e-tablets, and mobile applications (Plantix) might be used for future pests and illness recognition and monitoring 47 Because application of IPM programs depends largely on info, it is expected that a giant action being taken in areas such as concepts of insect sampling, computer system programs and mathematics, understanding of pests biological and environmental elements, and simulation strategies and modeling 11 Furthermore, meteorological and geostatistical computer system designs can reinvent forecasting and tracking of insect pests, which, eventually improve decision-making for IPM.</p>

<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "compatible."

<p>Concurrently, it is also based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or discouraged far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide issues are triggered by a small number of the pesticides available today. </p>
