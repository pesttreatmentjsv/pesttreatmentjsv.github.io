<p>The method to be selected for IPM depends on many aspects, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests trigger considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our specialists inspect your houses for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management specialists can use video to record and narrate inspections and leave a copy for the center manager via email, or carry out a real-time video co-inspection with the client if they are not able to be present at their center throughout the examination.</p>
