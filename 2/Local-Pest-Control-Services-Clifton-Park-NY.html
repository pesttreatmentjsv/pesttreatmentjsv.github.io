Refer to the Woody Ornamental Bug, Mite, and Illness Management Guide, released by Penn State Extension, or to another current recommendation for a list of products that are signed up for usage on plants in your state.</p>
<p>16 For standard farms IPM can minimize environmental and human exposure to harmful chemicals, and potentially lower total expenses. IPM minimizes hazards by decreasing general pesticide use, using least harmful pesticides when there is a demonstrated requirement, and taking unique protective procedures to reduce pesticide direct exposure living organisms and the environment.</p>
