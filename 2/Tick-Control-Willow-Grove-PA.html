<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate control choices can be made in combination with action limits.

AIPM is owned and operated by University graduates who majored in Biology and Pest Management with an emphasis on Animal Damage Management. Testing may require analyzing plants and recording the variety of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps may be utilized to catch the pest types to approximate pest abundance.</p>
<p>Pest control is an exceptionally crucial step owing to the reality that a number of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the eradication of a couple of pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).

A regular tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, regardless of the control strategies utilized.</p>
