<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are brought in to several areas that can provide any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all three. If much of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be used as the last resort, in concept, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of particular endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from common and persistent pest problems.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life stages. </p>

Employers often supply pest controller training programs covering pesticide application and key elements of the task like handling rodents and termites.</p>
