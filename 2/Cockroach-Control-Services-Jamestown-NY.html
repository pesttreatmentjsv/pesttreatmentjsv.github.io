<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. When action, recognition, and tracking limits show that pest control is needed, and preventive approaches are no longer effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the appropriate control technique both for effectiveness and danger. The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the main style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: An International Reality".</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them properly, so that proper control decisions can be made in combination with action limits. However, the significant trend has been towards using modern chemistry and molecular biology to change conventional pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; however these methods are still therapies.</p>
<p>The principle of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for managing pests, has remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their advancement and further feeding on the kept crop.</p>
<p>The determination of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides harmful to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life stages. </p>
