While chemical pesticides ought to be used as the last hope, in principle, often they are the first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of particular endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to secure the seed and transplants from common and persistent pest problems.</p>
<p>These might or may not include materials listed on the Organic Products Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in natural farming and natural gardening are usually more secure than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more environmentally friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can trigger damage.</p>
