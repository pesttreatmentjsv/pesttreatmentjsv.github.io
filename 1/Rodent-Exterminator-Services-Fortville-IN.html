Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides. </p>
