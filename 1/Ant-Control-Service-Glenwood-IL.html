<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the nationwide or regional level in the majority of countries, and in many it has ended up being official governmental policy. The use of chemical agents to deal with either regular pest mitigation or more established invasions should be left to professional pest management companies who are trained and certified in accordance with state regulations and health and safety requirements.</p>
<p>Throughout our quest for alternative pest control procedures, the IPM principle has actually without a doubt gotten the most attention as a thorough pest management approach.
