<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the nationwide or regional level in the majority of countries, and in many it has ended up being official governmental policy.

<p>Throughout our quest for alternative pest control procedures, the IPM principle has actually without a doubt gotten the most attention as a thorough pest management approach.
