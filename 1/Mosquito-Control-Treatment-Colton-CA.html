<p>The course will focus on the ecological and management principles of pest control and you will discover to assess the repercussions of pesticide use and application on the biological target. The United States EPA Biopesticides page contains better details. Adoption of IPM can be seen under a continuum, starting with systems mostly confined to using a single tactical approach such as utilizing economic thresholds for much better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses much of the exact same concepts as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides. </p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and are subject to greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, an efficient, nondisruptive method to handle a moderate beet armyworm outbreak might be to retard its advancement and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, therefore strengthening the parasitoids' effect throughout subsequent generations.</p>
