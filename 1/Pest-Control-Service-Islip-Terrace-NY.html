<h3>Termite Control Systems Islip Terrace New York</h2>
<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and basic pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management.

<p>In Asia, various stages of IPM have actually been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
