<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to secure its people from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by spraying pesticides (insecticides), applying larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its residents on lowering the conditions that cultivate increases in the mosquito population. The service received (Cockroach control) was expert and extremely prompt. When pest or diseases levels are low and actions most efficient, early detection of illness and pests leads to prompt action.

<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
