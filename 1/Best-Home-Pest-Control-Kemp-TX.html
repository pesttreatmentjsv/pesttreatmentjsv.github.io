Also, consider policies and treatments that may unintentionally present pests: storage practices and devices, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. The term was later on broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (13 ). Subsequently, under the term IPM," numerous authors have advocated the concept of integrating the complete selection of pest management practices together with production goals into an overall systems technique.</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in recent years given that fire eliminates helpful insects in addition to the pests and can have a negative influence on the soil. To decrease prospective harm to beneficial insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "refuges" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
