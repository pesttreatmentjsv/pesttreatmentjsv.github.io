<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>

This method refers to using a variety of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
