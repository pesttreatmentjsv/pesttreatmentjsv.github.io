<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be really effective in triggering significant reductions in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural opponents or saving natural opponent populations by offering havens or preventing practices that harm them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>

Pesticides not consisted of in baits or traps should generally just be applied to targeted areas, not sprayed over the whole room.
