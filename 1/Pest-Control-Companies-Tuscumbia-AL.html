Threat for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (safe or helpful) species that habituate in the fields or orchards. These pests are merely anywhere and everywhere, be it homes, offices, companies, dining places, hotels etc, anywhere which is not actually maintained properly and is not sanitary. </p>
