<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to consist of all tactics. This chapter talks about various methods to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or to put it simply integrated pest management (IPM).
