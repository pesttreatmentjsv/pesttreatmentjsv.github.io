Classical biological control includes introducing natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural enemies do not provide control.</p>
<p>Selection of controls for private pests should be made with the entire crop management system in mind. Our objective is to remove all types of pests such as black ants, red ants, spiders, cockroaches and other bugs from your residential or business property.
