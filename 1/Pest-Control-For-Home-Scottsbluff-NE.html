Pest control is the policy or management of a species defined as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities.</p>
<p>This brand-new design is anticipated to direct IPM strategies around the world to develop and carry out sustainable farming practices to guarantee success for the growers, affordability to customers, and food security to the growing world population. For instance, host plant resistance is efficiently utilized in some crops with pest and disease resistant or tolerant varieties, but not in other crops.</p>
<p>Pest control is an exceptionally important step owing to the fact that a number of pests are carriers of hazardous disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control professionals regularly utilize pheromones traps as a way to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
