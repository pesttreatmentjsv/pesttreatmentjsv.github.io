Truly satisfying services to pest problems will need a shift to understanding and promoting naturally occurring biological representatives and other inherent strengths as elements of total farming environments and developing our cropping systems so that these natural forces keep the pests within appropriate bounds.</p>
<p>An extensive understanding of general IPM concepts and different management alternatives for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We usually recommend pest control chemicals that get the job done using the least amount of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last resort). These avoidance and control methods consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative approaches.</p>
<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are brought in to several areas that can provide any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all three.

Ants live in the smallest of the cracks and are typically found inside the walls, cabinets, corners of the wall, and so on Smart resistance management will be a secret for sustainable use of GM crops in IPM while there is a requirement for better harmonization of GM crops with existing IPM techniques.</p>
