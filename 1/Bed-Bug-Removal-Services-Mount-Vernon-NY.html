The historic and more prevalent use of this term is restricted to use of natural enemies to manage populations of pest organisms. Some scientists likewise acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might happen, even yearly management of a constant pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>Physical controls consist of mulches for weed management, steam sanitation of the soil for illness management, or barriers such as screens to keep birds or insects out.
