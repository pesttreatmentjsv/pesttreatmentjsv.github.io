Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about reducing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
