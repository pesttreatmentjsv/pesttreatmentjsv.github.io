<h3>Pest Control Myths Arnold MD</h3>

IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in fact requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the center itself will bring in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of ethical and rational factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
